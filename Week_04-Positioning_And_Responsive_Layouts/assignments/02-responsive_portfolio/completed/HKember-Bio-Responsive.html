  <h1>Henry Kember <br>Miserably Bad<br>Web Design.</h1>

  <p>Hi. My name is Henry Kember. I have zero experience designing websites. Hell, I have zero experience using this programme. Check out some fictional examples of work I've done
    <a href="/ga-fewd-20-assignments/Week_01-Basics/Assignment/HKember-Work.html">here.</a></p>
  <h2>Experience</h2>

  <p>I got a mate to make a website for me once. It was horrible. Bits of text would load over the top of thumbnails, and the whole thing was a little embarrassing.</p>

 
  <div id="section">
